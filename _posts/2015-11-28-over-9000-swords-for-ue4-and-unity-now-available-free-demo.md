Yes, you read that right &#8211; I think we&#8217;re probably one of the first cross-engine asset packs that doesn&#8217;t just consist of meshes, textures or art assets. Over 9000 Swords has been <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/over-9000-swords" target="_blank">available on the Unreal Engine Marketplace</a> for a good few weeks now, but earlier this week we finally got it <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/48554" target="_blank">released on the Unity Asset Store</a> as well!

Here&#8217;s a free demo of the Unity version! It contains a small selection of the included mesh parts for you to try

[Download Unity Demo (57 MB)](http://www.broad-strokes.com/download/9000SwordsUnityDemo.zip)

The written documentation for it is available on this site as well now (<a href="http://www.broad-strokes.com/tools/over-9000-swords/ue4-docs/" target="_blank">UE4</a>/<a href="http://www.broad-strokes.com/tools/over-9000-swords/unity-docs/" target="_blank">Unity</a>), and if you require any assistance getting it set up in your game, Lee and I are available via a dedicated support Slack live chat we&#8217;ve set up just for you. Email <support@broad-strokes.com> with your order ID/purchase confirmation to get access! A bunch of video tutorials are also planned for those of you who like to watch, if you know what I mean.

So, what&#8217;s next? We&#8217;re already well on the way to the next pack, and there&#8217;s also a free update in the works that adds seasonally topical nondescript energy swords! We hope you like this &#8211; we&#8217;ve put a lot of effort into making this as usable and easy to extend as possible! The feedback we&#8217;ve got so far has been pretty positive, which fills us with joy! Thanks for making us happy, you awesome people ðŸ™‚ We&#8217;ll try to keep creating cool and useful things for you in the future!

Peace out!
