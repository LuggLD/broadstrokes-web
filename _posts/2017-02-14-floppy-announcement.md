Hey everyone! We've got a couple of things to catch you up on, so listen up!

We've been working on our own game for a little while now, and we're proud to announce [Floppy and the Sleepy Planet](http://www.sleepyplanetgame.com)! It's a cute little precision platformer, in which you control the eponymous Floppy, a robo-bunny, on his journey of exploration and self-discovery across a mysterious and seemingly abandoned world.

If you've been following our various social media channels, you've probably already seen more screenshots and video of the game. We originally started working on it in the April 2016 UE4 Gamejam under the title "Grabbity", and enjoyed such a positive reception - it was selected as one of the winning entries by the Epic Games team - that we decided to keep working on it.

Since then we've expanded and refined it, decided on a better name, and even [shown it off publicly](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.243740946043618.1073741830.122342758183438&type=1&l=9176a0fd71) at a few conventions. We'll try to blog more about it as we make progress, but in the meantime, why don't you do the subscribe-like-follow thing? Just use these handy little buttons:

In other news, we're happy to announce that Remi Crespo has joined the Broad Strokes team on a permanent basis! We've been working together for over a year now, and are now officially business partners. Check out the [Team](/team) page for a photo of his face and a little bio blurb about him!
