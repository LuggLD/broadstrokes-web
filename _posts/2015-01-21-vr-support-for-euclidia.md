I finally found the time to polish my December Unreal Engine gamejam entry Euclidia a little bit, and I have just uploaded an updated version. So I thought it was about time for a public release! The biggest newly added feature? Rift DK2 support!

You can [check it out](/games/gamejams/euclidia/ "Euclidia") right over there in the [Games section](/games/ "Games"). It&#8217;s still pretty rough, but this is probably going to be the final update. Considering the buggy state it was in at submission time for the gamejam it deserved a little more work, but as far as I&#8217;m concerned, with the addition of VR support, that game is done. I&#8217;ve learned about all I can from it, and it&#8217;s time to move on to other projects! Such as this:

Stay tuned for more on that in the next few days!

The website is also undergoing a bit of cosmetic improvement, which I&#8217;m very excited about.
