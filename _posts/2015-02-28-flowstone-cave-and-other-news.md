### Flowstone Cave experience released!

My [Flowstone Cave](http://www.broad-strokes.com/games/flowstone-cave/ "Flowstone Cave") is out now for the Rift DK2 and regular non-VR Windows desktops! Download it for free right here: [Download](http://www.broad-strokes.com/games/flowstone-cave/ "Flowstone Cave")

Ahum. So technically it&#8217;s been out for a few days, but I was pretty busy with preparations for GDC and didn&#8217;t get around to actually announcing it anywhere. So, here you are! This project is a short exploration experience which takes you into a flowstone cave, as the name _might_ suggest. There is no objective, no game mechanics &#8211; just walk around, take in the sights, play with the light switches and immerse yourself in the environment!

I especially recommend you try this with a Rift DK2, if you have one.

<a title="Flowstone Cave" href="http://www.broad-strokes.com/games/flowstone-cave/">Download now!</a> And if you like it, I&#8217;ll totally love you if you share it with your friends on Twitter or Facebook <3

As a bit of background information, I made this environment as a way to beta test my friend Yoeri Vleer&#8217;s upcoming rock & cave asset package to be released on the UE4 marketplace. Gotta say, I was impressed with how easy it was to work with it, and how versatile the assets. As a bonus, check out <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Hw0Gi" target="_blank">this gallery</a> he made of my cave level with textures from the upcoming <a href="https://trello.com/c/LmWt4mGn/286-natural-tiling-materials-pack" target="_blank">Natural Tiling Materials</a> pack! And if you plan to get that package when it comes out, you&#8217;ll be happy to hear that a slightly modified version of this cave will be included as a showcase example!

On to the other news:

### GDC

Oh god, GDC. I&#8217;m going to be there! Epic Games are <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/community-members-gdc" target="_blank">flying a few community members</a> to San Francisco to help out at the Unreal Engine booth, and I&#8217;m one of them! Still can&#8217;t quite believe it, to be honest &#8211; but I&#8217;ll be on a plane to the US in just a few short days. If you&#8217;re there, come say hi! I&#8217;m gonna be the dreadlock hippie with the grin on his face ðŸ˜‰ I have no idea how well I&#8217;ll be able to get online while there, but I&#8217;ll try to be active on Twitter. But if it turns out too busy, I&#8217;ll at least post my impressions after. Exciting times!

### Two more gamejam games

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-319 alignleft" title="" src="http://www.broad-strokes.com/images/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/memoryerror-300x169.jpg" alt="memoryerror" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://www.broad-strokes.com/images/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/memoryerror-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.broad-strokes.com/images/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/memoryerror-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://www.broad-strokes.com/images/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/memoryerror.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://www.broad-strokes.com/images/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/memoryerror.jpg)I&#8217;ve uploaded my submissions for the January and February Unreal Engine gamejams. In January, Sebastian Villarroel and I made [Memory Error](http://www.broad-strokes.com/games/memory-error/ "Memory Error"), a simple memory game in which you have to guide a jumping robot through a field of treacherous tiles, and remember the path you took. It was fun to make, especially since for a change I concentrated almost entirely on making the art. Which also explains why it&#8217;s not really up to snuff&#8230; but hey, gamejams! They&#8217;re for making things that are barely good enough in the spirit of &#8220;fuck it, ship it!&#8221;. So that&#8217;s all the excuses you&#8217;ll get out of me.

The goal of the game is to have everyone admire you, so you&#8217;ll be crowned prom king/queen. And just like in real life, falling in love yourself means that you lose. That was a joke. I did almost none of the art on this one, but almost all of the blueprint programming, so blame me for when things break. Aaron and the others outdid themselves, the amount of assets they&#8217;ve created in such a short amount of time was staggering! This one was a lot of fun to make, and I learned a whole bunch of things about AI programming in Unreal Engine 4.

### Upcoming UE4 Marketplace Package

Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve also been working on a marketplace package that should be quite useful for level designers. It&#8217;s a system to easily create complex networks of splined meshes, such as tunnels or sewers, road networks, fences, or race tracks. I&#8217;m still going to be working on it for a bit, but it already lets you create arrays of multiple spline meshes with randomization parameters, have full, detailed control over the sub-meshes on each segment, attach them to intersections or each other in any way you want, deform them, use my auto-tiling feature or control spline tiling manually &#8211; you can even create a loop-the-loop with it. I&#8217;m going to be posting more info as I make more progress, and you can except a few tutorial videos when I submit it to the marketplace as well. In the meantime, here&#8217;s a little sneak peek:
