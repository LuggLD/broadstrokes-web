## Jan Kaluza

Jan is the stereotype of self-sufficient developer, competent in programming, design, and art. After an early start into game development via the original Unreal Tournament's level design scene, his path led him on a few detours. An attempted career as a rock star and many years of extensive studies as a cultural anthropologist later, he said "Hmm, nah!" and went back to making games instead.
